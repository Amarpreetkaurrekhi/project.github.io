<h2 style="background-color:olivedrab;color: white; text-align:center;">FOR THE KIND ATTENTION OF PARENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Education is not synonymous with academics. In order to develop the all round personality of every child, the school attaches a lot of importance to the extra – curricular activities. It is mandatory for all the students to participate in the activities at all possible levels. Parents are requested to encourage their ward in this regard.</li>
    <li>Attendance and uniform are the two areas where the school is very strict. Late comers and uniform defaulters will be sent back home.</li>
    <li>Parents must pay the school fees in time to avoid any inconvenience. Students with fees in arrears will not be allowed to appear in examination.</li>
    <li>Attendance of the parents at PTM is mandatory. Parents who fail to attend PTM will be doing so at the risk of their wards performance and therefore promotion prospects.</li>
    <li>In PTM, parents are requested to bring the school diary of their ward to discuss about their progress in academics and co- curricular activities</li>
    <li>Constructive suggestions from the parents are always welcome.</li>
</ul>
